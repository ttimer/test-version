Let's start with two DEB-Installation-Packages: 

Install it with a graphical tool, like "gdebi" or "qapt". 
Or simply use the command line: 

    sudo dpkg -i smonitor-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -i ttimer-2.0.deb

If terminal and file are not in the same folder you have to add the path, of course -- e.g.: 

    sudo dpkg -i /home/"NAME"/Downloads/ttimer-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -i /home/"NAME"/Downloads/smonitor-2.0.deb
