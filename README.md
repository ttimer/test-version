Let's start with two DEB-Installation-Packages: 

Install it with a graphical tool, like "gdebi" or "qapt". 
Or simply use the command line: 

    sudo dpkg -i smonitor-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -i ttimer-2.0.deb

If terminal and file are not in the same folder you have to add the path, of course -- e.g.: 

    sudo dpkg -i /home/"NAME"/Downloads/ttimer-2.0.deb
    sudo dpkg -i /home/"NAME"/Downloads/smonitor-2.0.deb


-- upgrade 20210814 ------

Adding jar files 
  for other Linux distributions (not using .deb), 
  other OS (like Mac OSx, Windows ...) 
  or simply as a purist variant.

    java test -h
    
    java test -v
    
    java -jar SMonitor.jar
    try: java -jar SMonitor.jar --help
    
    java -jar ttimer.jar
    try: java -jar ttimer.jar -v
    hint: [F1] when the timer is up


============================================================== 

I had to add ".zip" to "ttimer.jar" to use the upload here. 

Just delete it on your download.
